# ðŸ”™ðŸ’» BackEnd Server

This is the Backend part of the Mern app for generating a friend list. This is mainly built using Nodejs, Express framework for routing and MongoDB Atlas for database. We use monogoose to make connection with the database.

We use heroku for hosting the apis.

You can find the the client side or front end server at https://github.com/adiada/mern-friendlist-server hosted using netlify.
